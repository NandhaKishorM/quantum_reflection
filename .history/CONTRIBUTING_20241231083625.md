## Code of Conduct

Our project is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. We expect all participants to adhere to the following principles:

- Show respect and courtesy to all community members
- Welcome diverse perspectives and experiences
- Focus on constructive feedback and discussions
- Exercise empathy in all interactions

Any violations of these principles should be reported to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, please ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/quantum_reflection.git
   cd quantum-math-reasoning
   ```
3. Set up your development environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
4. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Process

We follow a structured development process to maintain code quality and ensure smooth collaboration:

### Branch Naming Convention

- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description`
- Documentation: `docs/description`
- Performance improvements: `perf/description`

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `main`
2. Implement your changes
3. Write or update tests
4. Update documentation
5. Run the test suite
6. Submit a pull request

### Commit Messages

Write clear and descriptive commit messages following these guidelines:

```
type(scope): Brief description of the change

Detailed explanation of the changes and their motivation.
Include any breaking changes or important notes.

Fixes #123 (if applicable)
```

Types include: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`

## Code Standards

We maintain high standards for code quality and consistency:

### Python Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for function arguments and return values
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use docstrings for all classes and functions

Example of proper code style:

```python
from typing import List, Optional

def calculate_quantum_state(
    input_vector: np.ndarray,
    dimension: int,
    iterations: Optional[int] = None
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Calculate the quantum state representation of the input vector.

    Args:
        input_vector: Input vector to transform
        dimension: Dimension of the quantum state
        iterations: Optional number of iterations

    Returns:
        Transformed quantum state vector
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Testing Guidelines

All new code must include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for critical operations
- Edge case coverage

Test files should be placed in the `tests/` directory and follow this pattern:

```python
def test_quantum_state_calculation():
    """Test quantum state calculation with valid input."""
    input_vector = np.random.rand(10)
    result = calculate_quantum_state(input_vector, dimension=10)
    assert result.shape == (10,)
    assert np.allclose(np.linalg.norm(result), 1.0)
```

## Documentation Requirements

Good documentation is crucial for our project:

### Code Documentation

- All public functions must have docstrings
- Include examples in docstrings where appropriate
- Document exceptions and edge cases
- Keep comments current with code changes

### Project Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Maintain API documentation
- Provide usage examples
- Document configuration options

## Submitting Changes

When submitting a pull request:

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation
3. Include a clear description of changes
4. Reference any related issues
5. Add notes about breaking changes

Your pull request should include:

- Clear title describing the change
- Detailed description of modifications
- List of testing performed
- Screenshots/examples if applicable
- Updated documentation

## Community and Communication

Join our community channels for discussion and support:

- GitHub Discussions: Technical discussions and feature requests
