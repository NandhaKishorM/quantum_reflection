Let me solve this step by step.

First, let's try to understand what happens for n = 1:

For n = 1, we need ⌊α⌋ to be a multiple of 1
This is always true for any real number α
So n = 1 gives us no restrictions on α


Let's try n = 2:

We need ⌊α⌋ + ⌊2α⌋ to be a multiple of 2
Let's call the fractional part of α as {α}, so α = ⌊α⌋ + {α}
Then 2α = 2⌊α⌋ + 2{α}
⌊2α⌋ = 2⌊α⌋ + ⌊2{α}⌋
So ⌊α⌋ + ⌊2α⌋ = ⌊α⌋ + 2⌊α⌋ + ⌊2{α}⌋ = 3⌊α⌋ + ⌊2{α}⌋
This sum must be even
Therefore ⌊2{α}⌋ must have the same parity as -3⌊α⌋


For n = 3:

We need ⌊α⌋ + ⌊2α⌋ + ⌊3α⌋ to be a multiple of 3
Similarly, we can write 3α = 3⌊α⌋ + 3{α}
⌊3α⌋ = 3⌊α⌋ + ⌊3{α}⌋


Looking at these patterns:

For any n, ⌊kα⌋ = k⌊α⌋ + ⌊k{α}⌋ for k = 1,2,...,n
The sum must be divisible by n
This means Σ⌊k{α}⌋ must have a specific value mod n to cancel with the sum of k⌊α⌋


A key observation:

If α is an integer, all terms are multiples of their position number
For example, if α = 1, then at each n: 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2
This works for all positive integers


Another key observation:

If α is not an integer, the fractional parts build up and eventually cause issues
Unless α is rational with a very specific form that maintains the divisibility property


Therefore:

α must be an integer
This is both necessary and sufficient, as we can verify that any integer value of α will satisfy the condition for all n



The answer is: All integers are solutions to this problem, and no non-integer real numbers are solutions.
To verify:

For any integer α and any positive integer n:

⌊kα⌋ = kα for k = 1,2,...,n
The sum becomes α(1 + 2 + ... + n) = α·n(n+1)/2
This is always a multiple of n since (n+1)/2 is an integer when n is odd, and α is an integer.



Therefore, Z (the set of all integers) is the complete solution set.
